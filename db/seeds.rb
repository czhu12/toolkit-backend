# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# Uncomment the following to create an Admin user for Production in Jumpstart Pro
# user = User.create(
#   name: "Admin User",
#   email: "email@example.org",
#   password: "password",
#   password_confirmation: "password",
#   terms_of_service: true
# )
# Jumpstart.grant_system_admin!(user)
