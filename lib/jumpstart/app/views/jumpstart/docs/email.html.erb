<p class="text-xl">Jumpstart Pro provides easy configuration for transaction email providers.</p>

<%= h2_with_anchor "Transactional Email Services" %>
<p>We have looked up the configurations for several different transactional email providers so you don't have to waste time fiddling with configs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amazon SES</li>
  <li>MailPace (Previously OhMySMTP)</li>
  <li>Mailgun</li>
  <li>Mailjet</li>
  <li>Mandrill</li>
  <li>Postmark</li>
  <li>SendInBlue</li>
  <li>Sendgrid</li>
  <li>SparkPost</li>
</ul>

<p>To add credentials for your transactional email provider, check out <%= link_to "the Credentials section", credentials_docs_path, target: :_blank, class: "text-blue-500 underline" %> in the docs.</p>

<%= h2_with_anchor "Default From Email" %>
<p>We'll also configure your Rails app's default from email address for transactional emails sent by your app. This could be as simple as <code>noreply@example.com</code> or your support email address.</p>
<p>You can also include a name if you would like a pretty name in your emails such as <code>My App &lt;noreply@example.com&gt;</code></p>
